Windows 7 USB and No compatible USB devices detected - Last Modified 2013-08-08 00:46 UTC - Created 2013-08-08 00:37 UTC
Using the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool and run into "Windows 7 USB and No compatible USB devices detected"?

The tool doesn't like some USB drives (especially large hard drives inside enclosures).

Just create it manually with diskpart and 7-zip (from a Windows 7 64-bit or 32-bit system of course).

Notes from above link in-case it goes dead:

Open an admin cmd prompt (Start, cmd, ctrl+shift+enter)

>diskpart
 >list disk
 >select disk #
 >clean
 >create partition primary
 >select partition 1
 >active
 >format quick fs=fat32
 >assign
 >exit

Extract the Windows 7 ISO to the root of the drive.

If you want NTFS instead of FAT32 you also need to do "Bootsect.exe /nt60 X:" which you will find the bootsect.exe on the extracted drive in \boot\bootsect.exe

This does erase everything on the USB drive. Be careful.
